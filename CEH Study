(it will ask you to select apache2 or lighttpd)(Choose apache2)
Next, you will get a prompt which will be opened to configure a database for phpmyadmin with dbconfig-common. Here you need to click on yes and the enter.
Again, you will get a prompt which will ask you to submit the password for phpMyAdmin, to register with the database server. Here we have given 123 as the password as it is essential to give it a password now. 
The next step is the configuration of phpmyadmin under apache, for this we need to edit apache2 conf file by adding two lines at the end of this file:

nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Open the config file and add the 2 lines given below at the end.

#phpMyAdmin Configuration
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

save the nano file with ctrl+o,enter and ctrl+x

service apache2 restart
apt install vsftpd
